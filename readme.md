    Static typing: TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that the types of variables and expressions are known at compile time. This can help to prevent errors and make code more readable and maintainable.
    Interfaces: Interfaces are a way to define the structure of an object or class. They can be used to ensure that objects conform to a certain set of requirements.
    Classes: Classes are a way to create reusable code. They can be used to define the behavior and properties of objects.
    Generics: Generics are a way to create functions or types that can work with different data types. This can make code more flexible and reusable.
    Namespaces: Namespaces are a way to organize code into logical groups. This can help to improve code readability and maintainability.
    Modules: Modules are a way to encapsulate code into self-contained units. This can help to improve code reuse and modularity.
    Decorators: Decorators are a way to add metadata to code. This can be used to extend the functionality of classes or functions.
    Type inference: TypeScript can infer the types of variables and expressions based on their values. This can help to make code more concise and readable.
    Null and undefined safety: TypeScript provides null and undefined safety, which means that it can detect errors when these values are used in unexpected ways.

These are just some of the key features and concepts of TypeScript. There are many other features that make TypeScript a powerful and versatile language.
